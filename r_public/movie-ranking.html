    <h1>The Best Movies According to Raydon</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies/Series</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Ride Along and Ride Along 2</h3>
    <p>This is a movie about Kevin Hart and Ice Cube where Kevin applies to join the police academy and goes for a "ride along" with his soon to be brother in law, who is not fond of him ast all and does not approve of him wanting to marry his sister. Waht was supposed to be a prank to scare Kevin off turns into a real life police matter. Great Movie, and a must watch from me!</p>

    <h3>Silicon Valley</h3>
    <p>Awesome series that every coder/programmer should watch. It depicts the exact ups/downs and all obstacles a tech startup has. It is a really "dry" comedy, but you can't help but laugh for everything that these gusy get up to.</p>

    <h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
    <p>Game of Thrones plays off in a time when dragons were still roaming the earth, and whoever could tame them, became the ultra powerful. It's a great series, full of action, drama, twists and turns, and is definitely bingeable, if you're looking for something to enjoy on a longweekend.</p>
