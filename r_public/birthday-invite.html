    <h3>What to bring:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cake, tarts, and whatever is sweet (I'm a sugar tooth and I'm sure you are too!)</li>
        <li>Beverages! Juice, softdrinks, whatever you will go great with the cake and tarts. (You can bring your own alcohol, but none for me thanks.)</li>
        <li>A really big appetite (There will be food to feed a whole army!)</li>
    </ul>
